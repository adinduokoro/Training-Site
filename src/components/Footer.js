          <p>WDFTRAINING holds limited space and many of our classes sell out. For this reason, we request that you cancel at least 72 hours before scheduled class. This will allow us to offer your spot to another consumer. You may contact us via phone +1 443-630-3752 between the hours of 9am - 5pm EST to cancel.</p>
          <p>Please note, we do not offer refunds, however if you give us at least 48 hours notice of your need, we will credit your deposit toward another class. However, if you do not cancel with atleast 72 hours notice, you will lose any payments you have already made.</p>
